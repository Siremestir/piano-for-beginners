# Piano MOOC 3rd Week
## Welcome to your third piano lesson !

## This week you will practice your reading and start playing the right hand of Swan Lake composed by Tchaikovsky

First, have a look at the music sheets of Swan Lake below and try reading the first bar. 

(maybe set the first bar as a sample and give out the answer ?)

(insert music sheets here)

Now try putting your fingers on the keys according to the fingering below and then you can start playing the first bar.

(insert fingering here)

Next, once you're able to read it and play it easily, practice reading and playing the first staff.

(add some tips/advices here)

Afterwards keep practicing your reading and playing step by step.

It would be a great start if by the end of this lesson you could finish practicing the right hand if you still don't feel comfortable yet with it.
